# control_for_gps-positioning
First try on GitHub for gps-Positioning of an UVA.
The target is to integrate the data output of a piksi into the control of positioning-hold-function for a multicopter.
If the absolute position is not important, the data of the relative distance between the rover and the base
(north, east and down) can be used to get anywhere a high accuracy in holding one position.
